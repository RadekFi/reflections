How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Quickly shows differences between two files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can use previous versions if I make a mistake or see the progress in programming

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: you decide when is the proper moment to commit Cons: you can forget to do it
	On the contrary, automatically saved docs will produce commits not necessary after logical changes, which makes harder to fix the bugs

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Files interact together to run program properly. Sometimes you need to make changes in more than one file to achieve your goal. As a result, saving multiple files in one commit make it easier to undo your changes if problems occur. Tracking file changes seperately make sense if files are no related to each other. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    With git log I get the list of all commits. Git diff shows differencies between two commits. "+" is added before addidtions and "-" is added before deletions. 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    You can easily go back to previous version of a file and compare it to the version with the bug and look for differences.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I'm going to use it to backup versions of my files in a new project.
